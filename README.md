##Calculator web service
###Introduction:
This is a college project produced for the Web Service course at CYU.
We wanted to create a basic calculator service using jax ws and jax rs. We were also asked to show more informations about the operation thanks to wikipedia.
##SOAP Web Service / REST Web Service
We tried to implement a matrix calculus service but we couldn't use tables as arguments for the web service, so we didn't use this operation in the end.
You can use the service to add numbers, substract them, divide or multiply them. We could add more basic operation like square root etc.


For our project we have built a client using React.js who is javascript based frontend library.
In order to run the client:

You need to download it from the frontend branch here on GitHub
-Make sure you have node.js install on your machine/computer

-run the  "npm install" command
-run the "npm start command"



make sure that the tomcat server of the web service is running otherwise you won't be able to perform any operation.



-The web service has two implementation one  using jax-rs and the other one using jax-ws

-we have used the Media wiki api  in order to fetch data about the current operation that is being performed by the user. You can see that within the information section of our project client.
