##Calculator web service
###Introduction:
This is a college project produced for the Web Service course at CYU.
We wanted to create a basic calculator service using jax ws and jax rs. We were also asked to show more informations about the operation thanks to wikipedia.
##SOAP Web Service / REST Web Service
We tried to implement a matrix calculus service but we couldn't use tables as arguments for the web service, so we didn't use this operation in the end.
You can use the service to add numbers, substract them, divide or multiply them. We could add more basic operation like square root etc.



In order to run the client:

download it from the frontend branch here on GitHub
-Make sure you have node.js install on your machine
-run npm install command
-run the npm start command




-The web service has two implementation one  using jax-rs and the other one using jax-ws
